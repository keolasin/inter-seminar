# Ethical Dilemmas/Problems

## Rationing Problems

1. Fair chances vs best outcomes - how much should we favor producing the best outcome vs giving each person a fair chance?
2. Aggregation - when should we allow an aggregation of modest benefits to larger numbers of people to outweigh more significant benefits to fewer people?
3. Priority - how much priority should we give to treating the sickest or most disabled patients
4. Democracy - when must we rely on a fair democratic process as the only way to determine what constitutes a fair rationing outcome?

### Democracy

Value pluralism - we have different values for health.

Deontology vs Utilitarianism

- principles:

    - respect for autonomy
    - justice
    - beneficence

- all underlaid by human rights

### What are values? Where are they involved in the concept map?

- the things we really care about, the beliefs we have about what's most important.
- involves reasons, desires, motivations

We can reason about values, but it's not how we form those values.

- we all have different lived experiences, and we might be blind to other values, since we have varying lived experiences
- people have values and reasons behind them, but they can clash against other group values, resulting in the *democracy* problem

#### National Approach to Health Values?

- state level in Oregon, used QALYs to rank treatments and resource allocation
    - OR end up sued by ADA because able-bodied people ranked quality of life (QOL) lower for disabilities than those with disabilities do
    - if you haven't had that particular problem, how can you speak to that QOL? Or, alternatively, if you have had that problem and adjusted, can you adequately assess?

### Issue with Health values

In our health system, we typically have one system (CMS), need to agree on values and what's important.

Need to reach agreement on values.

- might do it through reasoning, or manipulation, coercion, and unethical means

### If we don't know our values, how can we impart them to the public with trust?

- what are the values informing decisions? Transparency allows for accountability to the public

### Values process and determination

Holland 1995 - most important healthcare value was social solidarity, everyone should feel included and taken care of

- worst violation was for those with cognitive impairments not feeling integrated well enough

UK - Nulfield council, communitarian health goals, accepted that at a certain age you don't get dialysis
