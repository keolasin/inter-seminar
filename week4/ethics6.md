# Precautionary Principle

- precautionary measures before fully establishing causality.
- from German 'vorsorge_prinzip': fore-caring. In order to make progress, we need foresight and preparation
- foresight and preparation, not just caution or reluctance.

## Implementation

- explore alternative to possibly harmful approach
- place burden of proof on proponents of the activity
    - the proponents need to establish the safety and have responsibility to show how it might affect people
- set measurable goals for protection
- democracy and transparency

### Examples

FDA: testing new drugs before market
Food Quality and Protection Act (1996): pesticides must be proven safe for children or be removed
National EPA: safety of chemicals


## Genome editing

also called gene editing, it's a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an organism's DNA.

- these techs allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome.
- several approaches to genome editing have been developed

One approach is CRISPR-Cas9.

### Societal & ethical impacts of germline genome editing: how can we secure human rights?

- somatic cell editing
    - only affects your current life
    - seen as permissible
- germline editing
    - affects the future of your progeny

### Background

Gene Editing

- CRISPR is clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats: recognize very specific pieces of DNA, then enzymes like Cas-9 can cut the DNA at those places

Germline

- somatic vs germline

Public Health/Societal

### Crashing through Societal Barrier

Nov 2018 - He Jiankui announces the birth of genome-editing twins.

"International outcry over genome-edited baby claim"

- prohibited by many/all governments

### Ethical challenges

He Jiankui (JK) case raised important considerations

- need for pro research ethics
    - JK is a biophysicist, no prior research with human subjects
    - deceptive framing of the germline edit as necessary to prevent HIV
    - couple unlikely to otherwise receive sperm-washing to clear HIV
    - **violates Respect for Persons, Beneficence and Justice**
- ambiguity between treatment and enhancement
    - context dependent
    - from anti-cholesterol meds to editing PCSK9
    - question of: what is enhancement? in public health, we care about prevention
    - edited gene that helped provide immunity to HIV
    - father of the couple was HIV+
        - can reduce risk of parent-child transmission through IVF and sperm-washing
        - but, IVF and sperm-washing is expensive
        - thus, an incentive was created for the couple to consent to the gene editing
        - their germline is now HIV immune
- the necessity for clear and robust international regulatory frameworks

#### International Regulatory Frameworks

2016 international summit on human genome editing in 2015: "It would be irresponsible to proceed with any clinical use of germline editing..."

Current influential reports

- 2017 NASEM Human Genome Editing Consensus Report
- 2018 Nuffield Council Report

#### NAS Criteria

- absence of reasonable alternatives
- restriction to preventing a serious disease or condition
- continued reassessment of both health and societal benefits and risks, with broad on-going

#### Nuffield Criteria

- upholds principles of social justice and solidarity
- heritable editing interventions should only be permitted if the impact on vulnerable populations might not be increased and would be assessed and mitigated, along with inclusive consultation of people in those populations.

#### Proposed ethical approaches to GGE

Public Engagement (NAS)
Principles (Nuffield)

these are necessary, but not sufficient: 

also need human rights assessments

### Limits of public engagement

necessary:

- captures dissenting views
- establish conduits of transparency and expanded understanding
- procedural justice - fairness and inclusion
- respect for autonomy

insufficient

- framing problem (ex: NAS poll and omission of economics)
- undervalues perspectives of marginalized groups (ex: Orgeon)
- clashing value systems, lack of solidarity

### Limits of Ethical Principles

Necessary:

- respect for persons entails respect for autonomy and protection of those with diminished autonomy.
- equal regard for persons calls for upholding social justice and solidarity.

Insufficient:

- people use the same words for principles to mean different things in different countries and cultures.
- principles often compete, but there is no clear ranking.
- unlike principles, case-based analysis is responsive to real - not abstract - human experience. ex: US President's commission on brain death.

### Specific Concerns with GGE

- impact on people with disabilities: CF, SCD, Deaf communities
- increase health disparities and intergenerational injustice
- spectre of eugenics

## A Human Rights Impact Assessment

1. Clarify the public health purpose

- gov has a responsibility to articulate the ph purpose. these goals help to:
    - identify the true purpose of the intervention
    - facilitate public understanding and debate around legitimate health purposes
    - reveal prejudice, stereotypical attitudes, or irrational fear

- do the AZT placebo trials have a clearly articulated public health purpose?

2. Evaluate likely policy effectiveness

- a deliberative process should consider scientific evidence of effectiveness, impacts on targeted individuals/groups, and whether the same results is better achieved by the proposed intervention compared to others

3. Determine whether the public health policy is well-targeted

- is the intervention selectively inclusive in a way that does not exclude already marginalized individuals and groups who may benefit? conversely, does the intervention target groups and individuals who do not need to be included?

- ex: is GGE well-targeted 

4. Examine each policy for potential human rights burdens

- first, using the international bill of human rights as a source (example), determine that no infringement on non-derogable human rights would result from the interventon. Consider whether equitable implementation of the intervention is possible and if true informed consent is achieved in advance.

5. Determine whether the policy is the least restrictive alternative that can achieve the public health objective

- effective interventions that do not violate human rights and dignity should take priority.

6. If a coercive public health measure is truly the most effective, least restrictive alternative, base it on the "significant risk" standard

- determined on a case-by-case basis, this standard permits coercive measures only in cases where necessary to avert harm to others. The threat of risk must be probable, not speculative, and not based on generalizations or stereotypes about certain groups or individuals.

7. If a coercive measure is truly necessary to avert a significant risk, guarantee fair procedures to the persons affected

- if the measure is truly necessary to avert risk, guarantee fair procedures to persons affected. if the measure interferes with personal rights or liberty, a fair and public hearing must be conducted to assure procedural justice.

## Ongoing discussions

- NASEM: Consensus Study Report on Heritable Human Genome Editing focuses on *safety* more than societal and ethical issues.
- WHO Expert Advisory Report on Human Genome Editing: 2021 report has no definitive statement on GGE. They issued a preliminary statement in 2019, but did not follow this up or affirm it definitively in 2021: "it would be irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human GGE."
    - should be reevaluated in future.


### Discussion Notes:

- Step 3: Is GGE well-targeted?
    - argument for No: application is so vague, the science is not well-targeted
        - impact on society is large enough as well
        - cost, might marginalize further
    - argument for Yes: communities/volunteers might be well-targeted enough
    - GGE might include individuals (future progeny, children) who did not want/need to be included, may be part of marginalized groups

- Step 4: implicatons humans rights burdens
    - might further divide in classes, equitable implementation
    - if we never research, how can we make progress?
    - cultural value to human characteristics associated/resulting from disease
    - people should be free of disease, but people who currently live with those disease might be further marginalized and not included
    - is informed consent possible? can we truly assess the impact and implications, and then relay that to the participant? Since it's so young, we can't really inform adequately.
    - manipulative
    - eugenicsey

- Step 5: is the policy the least restrictive alternative?
    - distinction between somatic gene editing and germline gene editing; there's an irreversible aspect to it
    - should we research/progress the other alternatives that might not have so many implications?
    - if we do genetic counseling, how do we still help?
    - many people would probably opt for GGE - but there's a cost/class divide where marginalized communities might not be able to participate in that alternative

- GGE maybe fails at steps 3-5, there might be potentials at each step
