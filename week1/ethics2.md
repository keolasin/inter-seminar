# Lecture 1.2: Ethics session 2

Mill: autonomy is important because you need to be able to make your own decisions to live a fulfilling life. Better society if people make their own decisions.
Kant: tradition, whether or not people choose the best outcomes, every person who is capable has the capacity to make their own choices. To overrule that is to treat them as a thing. Fundamental nature of human dignity that we respect autonomy.

## Criteria for autonomy

1. capacity/intention - ability to make decisions for oneself. ability to guide your decision - see that you have a decision to make. Able to make the decision with adequate understanding, know the risk/benefits
2. voluntary - ability to make the decision free of coercion or influence.
3. understanding - full knowledge to make an informed decision, able to adequately weigh the risk/benefits.

### Dollar a day and autonomy

Was paying $1 a day ($4 dollars a day today, about $28/week) a form of coercion? Was the pressure to stay in the group (through money, through social support) 

## Paternalism

An incentive that's meant to improve a persons well-being or health.

1. soft paternalism - get people to act on their own values
2. hard paternalism - stretches all the way to coercion

Middle - creating conditions that change peoples options (similar to dollar a day with the peer pressure, manipulating the circumstances of their life, potentially in a way that still respected autonomy)
Hard - obese people needing to attend weight loss programs or lose their job.

## Coercion

Maybe good for their health, but removing their options or overriding their values and thus not respecting their autonomy.

In our society, we put a persons autonomy over beneficience. It's more important for people to make their own decisions, even if it goes against their own well-being.

## Must give adequate information in public health, no deception at all

If people are given placebos, they need to know that they are being given a placebo (the placebo itself can be a deception)

### Dollar-a-day

Our autonomy rights extend to our reproductive rights, and our bodily tissues, and our information

## Informed Consent

The person participating in the study needs to be fully informed of the study, so they need to be capable (have decision-making capacity), weighing the risk/benefits, and how it relates to their values. We need to ensure adequate understanding - they've been given all the info, and test that they actually understand. Need to ensure they aren't under any undue pressure - should be entirely voluntary.
