# Ethics Session 4

Emily Winer - email about building design intersection with public health

## Concept Map

Overview of Primary Ethical Principles in PHW 289

### 1st layer: Deontology vs Utilitarianism

Deotonology considers duties and rights, gauging the rightness or wrongness of actions in relation to both processes and outcomes

Utilitarianism - actions need to maximize outcomes, end justifies the means so long as the end maximizes utility

### 2nd layer: Distributive Justice, Respect for Autonomy, Beneficence

### 3rd layer: Respect for Human Rights

respecting rights guaranteed to all human beings

## Alternative Concept Map

Individual level - ethical regard for individuals; respect for autonomy and beneficence

Group - ethical obligations to individual (deontology) vs. the group (which can be deontological, but we are focusing more on utilitarianism)

Distributive justice - speaks to limited resources

Human Rights - respect for human rights as a human being

Across these levels, there's diverse values

## History of regulations for ethics of human subject research

### Nuremburg Code (1947)

after WWII Nazi doctors were tried for war crimes in torture/murder of their research subjects, Nuremburg Code was developed

- Beneficence (protecting research subjects, ensuring the safety and voluntariness of participants)

### Declaration of Helsinki (1975)

Search for new knowledge, but this goal cannot override the rights of individuals (safety and interest of subjects come first)

### Tuskegee Syphilis US Public Health Service (into 1970s)

nearly 600 poor african american men in the south with syphilis were observed for effects of syphilis, despite treatment being available to see the course of the disease

#### Complicity of ignorance

who knew when? why did they not act?

toxic mixture of professional/institutional power and racism

### Willowbrook Case

Cognitive impaired patients injected with Hep A

### Guatemala

Directly injecting syphilis into male prisoners/psych 

### Belmont Report Commissioned

Met in 1979

Three principles:

1. Respect for persons (not the same as respect for autonomy)
    
If people have the capacity for autonomy, the way you show them respect is respecting their autonomy. But, if they lack capacity, or are living under conditions that are harsh, they aren't able to full exercise their autonomy. Need to protect them from harm or exploitation. If they have no other options, it's exploitative

2. Beneficence

Primary goal of research is new knowledge, but there's an obligation to take beneficence as a primary principle in how the research will affect society. Not harming and benefiting subjects, rights to protection from harm for the research subject.

3. Justice

Two ways to think of justice - 1) to not exploit or take advantage (or overly burden) a research group, and, 2) the population participating should benefit from the research.

## Group Activity: apply Belmont Report to AZT(076 HIV treatment) trials

Session with Kira Jeter

scientific & ethical issues from the AZT reading?

Arguing For Placebo

### Pro arguments for placebo trials

1. respect for persons - the co-design process with involved countries and health ministers ensured that the populations and participants were adequately respected, there was a question of autonomy - coercion isn't occurring 
2. beneficence - while trying to improve their situation, the new knowledge gained is valuable since the populations may be different enough (equipoise), and since its a public health emergency, equivalency studies were too time-consuming, and the local standard of care should be used here

### Problems with Belmont

Insufficent - how do we rank respect for persons, beneficence, and justice issues when they all exist in an ethical dilemma? Even when it exists within beneficence (public vs individual good)

Context might be missing - we need to consider the situation and conditions in which the dilemma is occurring. While Belmont papers address the philosophical issues, it doesn't include the real limitations/conditions that impact the dilemma.

AZT - today, a lot of leaders might argue for the trials

### Human Rights Impact Assessment

Human rights are the rights guaranteed to all human beings, simply by virtue of being human

- health is a human right; relates to all other human rights
- critical to respect/address HR in pu
    - helps maintain public trust/ongoing cooperation

#### Steps to HRIA

1. Clarify the public health purpose

- gov has a responsibility to articulate the ph purpose. these goals help to:
    - identify the true purpose of the intervention
    - facilitate public understanding and debate around legitimate health purposes
    - reveal prejudice, stereotypical attitudes, or irrational fear

- do the AZT placebo trials have a clearly articulated public health purpose?

2. Evaluate likely policy effectiveness

3. Determine whether the public health policy is well-targeted

4. Examine each policy for potential human rights burdens

5. Determine whether the policy is the least restrictive alternative that can achieve the public health objective

6. If a coercive public health measure is truly the most effective, least restrictive alternative, base it on the "significant risk" standard

7. If a coercive measure is truly necessary to avert a significant risk, guarantee fair procedures to the persons affected

### Infrigement on human rights

Is it okay or not? If it's not okay at all, it's a *violation* of human rights

Problem with beneficence is that it is discretionary - how much we protect people from harm, there is a discretionary judgment occurring.

Fundamental violations of a right - we have protection from exploitation, people can wind up in a position where they consent to exploitation, so we need to protect them from having to make that decision.

Sometimes in public health, we do infringe/violate a right

### Rights vs Preferences

Rights are what is guaranteed by the state or government or intrinsic, whereas a preference is not.

Wearing a mask is a preference, but bodily autonomy (and not getting vaccinated) is a right.
