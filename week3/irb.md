# IRBs and Ethics of Research Participation

## Human participation in research

Nuremberg Doctors Trial - war crimes in WWII, international military tribunal determined 20 physicians did medical experiments that constituted murder/torture

- Nuremberg Code: voluntary consent of participants is essential
- Stateville Penitentiary: malaria research in Illinois and question of incentivized research
- Joseph Goldberger: Rankin Prison Farm Trials - sentence pardoning if the prisoners participated in Mississippi (coercive)
- Richard Strong: Bilibid Prison Trials in Philippines investigated cholera vaccine injections + plague cultures

## Puerto Rico Pill Trials

3 women died after being given contraceptive pills, unclear if the participants gave informed consent

## Tuskegee

Syphillis given to 600 unknowing men, incentived, lasting 40 years. Treatment wasn't offered to the men involved.

US Public Health Service was performing the Tuskegee Syphillis study, left pervasive and deep scars on relationships between communities and researchers

## J. Marion Sims

Conducted painful experiments on enslaved black women to fix fistulas

## Belmont Report

1. the boundaries between biomed and behavioral research and the accepted and routine practice of med
2. the role of assessment of risk-benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research involving human subjects
3. appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in such research and,
4. the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings

### Key principles of the belmont report

1. Respect for Persons: individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection
2. Beneficence: two general rules have been formulated as complementary expressions of beneficent actions:

    - do not harm
    - maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms

3. justice: who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens? An injustice occurs when some benefit to which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unduly

## What is an IRB?

Institutional Review Boards: committees that review research protocol (e.g., universities, research institutes, teaching hospitals)

Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP): oversees IRB registration and provides regulatory oversight and is supported by US HHS

### What is human subjects research?

- Research: is the activity a systematic investigation designed to contribute to generalizable knowledge?
- Human Subjects Research: will you obtain info about living individuals through intervention or interaction and is the info individually identifiable?

### Informed Consent, Assent, and Permission

respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them:

1. info about the study
2. comprehension of consent content
3. voluntariness
4. assessment of risks and benefits
5. selection of subjects: who is participating
6. contact information: PI and study team
7. Parental permission/Minor Assent

### Templates from IRBs

Is the template consent form useful? Can ask if the provided info is something you would be comfortable with or having a family member participate in

## The Common Rule: vulnerable to coercion or undue influence & safeguarding participants

- children/minors
- people who are incarcerated
- people who are pregnant and neonates
  - no longer considered vulnerable but special considerations in place
- people who are economically disadvantaged
  - people experiencing homelessness
- people who are educationally disadvantaged
- people with impaired decision making capacity
- power differentials - vulnerability is contextual
- certificates of confidentiality

## Types of IRB review and reporting

- full
- expedited
- exempt
- adverse events
- continuing review

### Review Process overivew

1. Submit IRB application: study overview, aims, all procedures, study collection instruments, how info will be stored, risks and how risks will be addressed, detailed process of informed consent, additional worksheets for vulnerable pop, mandatory reporting procedures, and any additional MOUs or agreements associated with working w/ community partners
2. Review/resubmit with IRB response - given time to make edits/adjustments
3. Process may be in stages - must factor this time into study timeline
4. Resubmit if changes are made to study protocol

## Consumers of Peer Review and "Evidence"

An n sample size means that number, n, is each a member of a community who is contributing their time and effort to the research

## Berkeley Public Health Responds...

We are working on the leading edge of COVID-19 research to find game-changing solutions, educating the public through news and events, and mobilizing our community to serve Bay Area's most vulnerable populations during this pandemic.
