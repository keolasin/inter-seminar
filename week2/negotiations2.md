# Emotions & Feelings in Negotiations

Emotions in a negotiation should be:

1. Acknowledged
2. Named
3. Addressed
4. Managed

## Joel Schafer

Comissioner with Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service

"People don't remember what you do, but how you treated them."

Say no with a yes: finding an area of what's workable

## Acknowledgement and agreement

If I don't know/acknowledge what you want, I can't give you anything

Tendency to meet conflict with lies or exaggerations

## What is it that the parties really need? What do they really want?

4 phrases:

1. If being attacked - can defend or be inquisitive

## CYA: Check your assumptions

If there's a complex philosophical argument being used

## How do get to a compromise?

Sometimes, it's not possible. The best that can be done is the options available are analyzed, then chosen.
