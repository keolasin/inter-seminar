## Concept Map

Overview of Primary Ethical Principles in PHW 289

### 1st layer: Deontology vs Utilitarianism

Deotonology considers duties and rights, gauging the rightness or wrongness of actions in relation to both processes and outcomes

Utilitarianism - actions need to maximize outcomes, end justifies the means so long as the end maximizes utility

### 2nd layer: Distributive Justice, Respect for Autonomy, Beneficence

### 3rd layer: Respect for Human Rights

respecting rights guaranteed to all human beings

## Alternative Concept Map

Individual level - ethical regard for individuals; respect for autonomy and beneficence

Group - ethical obligations to individual (deontology) vs. the group (which can be deontological, but we are focusing more on utilitarianism)

Distributive justice - speaks to limited resources

Human Rights - respect for human rights as a human being

Across these levels, there's diverse values

## History of regulations for ethics of human subject research

### Nuremburg Code (1947)

after WWII Nazi doctors were tried for war crimes in torture/murder of their research subjects, Nuremburg Code was developed

- Beneficence (protecting research subjects, ensuring the safety and voluntariness of participants)

### Declaration of Helsinki (1975)

Search for new knowledge, but this goal cannot override the rights of individuals (safety and interest of subjects come first)

### Tuskegee Syphilis US Public Health Service (into 1970s)

nearly 600 poor african american men in the south with syphilis were observed for effects of syphilis, despite treatment being available to see the course of the disease

#### Complicity of ignorance

who knew when? why did they not act?

toxic mixture of professional/institutional power and racism

### Willowbrook Case

Cognitive impaired patients injected with Hep A

### Guatemala

Directly injecting syphilis into male prisoners/psych 

### Belmont Report Commissioned

Met in 1979

Three principles:

1. Respect for persons (not the same as respect for autonomy)
    
If people have the capacity for autonomy, the way you show them respect is respecting their autonomy. But, if they lack capacity, or are living under conditions that are harsh, they aren't able to full exercise their autonomy. Need to protect them from harm or exploitation. If they have no other options, it's exploitative

2. Beneficence

Primary goal of research is new knowledge, but there's an obligation to take beneficence as a primary principle in how the research will affect society. Not harming and benefiting subjects, rights to protection from harm for the research subject.

3. Justice

Two ways to think of justice - 1) to not exploit or take advantage (or overly burden) a research group, and, 2) the population participating should benefit from the research

## Group Activity: apply Belmont Report to AZT(076 HIV treatment) trials
