# Utilitarianism vs Distributive Justice

Ethical theories and problems in public health related to resource distribution

## Utilitarianism

Theoretical approach to maximize aggregate benefit for available resources

- Efficiency doesn't cover the distributive issues in using those resources in a fair manner

## Fair chance: Modified Daniels' example

Two people with kids - one after would live 15 years post-surgery, the other would live 20 years.

- The best outcome isn't the only ethical determinant

## Priorities problem

How much priority do we owe the least well-off people in society?

John Ralls' Theory of Justice - systematically, utilitarianism is blind to justice & fairness

There's a notion of fairness in helping people who are most disadvantaged?

- such a big part of what we do
- A community given a certain amount of funding to improve health outcomes
  - study done to determine what to do: fairly inexpensive to educate doctors, nurses, patients for those who already had care
  - getting patients who were worse off screened and into any treatment was more expensive
  - dilemma: probably need to do a bit of both, but how?

## Aggregation Problem

Oregon was trying to ration healthcare, and people rated benefits - small amount of benefit rating to vasectomies, tooth capping.

- in aggregate, these small benefits outweighed more individually impactful problems like hip repair or cancer treatment

## Democracy problem

which benefits we overall want from our resources isn't universally agreed on - perspective is important. Who speaks for the importance of a problem?

Those with disabilities sued Oregon because their perspective wasn't adequately included in the program
